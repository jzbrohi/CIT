# Website Architectures
Here we will see how the aarchitectures of Static aand Dynamic Websites works.

## Architecture of Static Wesites
Architecture of Static Websites is very simple. It has two steps. When we open a static website, our brwoser sends a http request to server and in response server sends aa http response and thats it. It gives all pages in one response.

## Architecture of Dynamic Websites
Architecture of Dynamic Websites is very complex one. It contains 4 steps. When we open a dynamic website, our browser sends a http request to server. Server calls a application program and runs it. Then finally it gives a http response of what we had requested. It gives response one by one e page.
